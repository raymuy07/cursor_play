      "description": "Tittle:\n Alarm system for the Monitoring Data System (MDS) and the supporting services related to MDS\nPurpose:\nStudy alternatives and implement a diverse alarm system for the MDS on its Kubernetes environment using Terraform for its deployment (or alternatively, use the Rancher user interface), as well as study alternatives and implement an alarm system for the ActiveMQ and Monitoring-Consumer services (supporting services of the MDS) that live in virtual machines and are deployed using Docker Compose. Finally, study possible improvements for the service of the MDS Data Gap Detector. Every specific objective must be thoroughly documented.\nDescription:\nThe Monitoring Data System (MDS) is a complex system that is responsible for storing and making available to the users the ALMA device's monitoring data. This system is delicate and there is currently a requirement for the Software Team of monitoring the different aspects of this system, including: Status of the Kubernetes cluster and the worker nodes that compose it, and status of the pods that are deployed in the Kubernetes (being the most important pods the ones that are related to the Database, implemented in Cassandra), for what is requested to implement alarms. Also, MDS has some supporting services, to be specific: Monitoring- Consumer, responsible for formatting the monitoring data so it can be inserted into the Cassandra database, and ActiveMQ, which is the queue service that queues the formatted monitoring data; these services are also required to be monitored and to send alarms when the servers go down or when the resources usage is too high, such as RAM and disk space. Finally, there is a service called Data Gap Detector, that monitors if the monitoring data queried on the MDS's API presents any data gap, and reports when this occurs; this application may have some improvements, and it is necessary to evaluate what improvements it could have.\nObjectives:\nGeneral Objective:\nImplement a variety of alarms to be deployed in the different environments related to the MDS. These alarms will allow the maintainers of those systems to be alerted of possible problems with their resources' usage and the status of the services.\nSpecific Objectives:\nImplement and thoroughly document the alarm system for the MDS, to live in its Kubernetes environment, using the infrastructure-as-code tool Terraform. Investigate and thoroughly document different alternatives for implementing an alarm system for the MDS's supporting applications, which live in virtual machines and are implemented using Docker containers. Implement and thoroughly document an alarm system that monitors the status of the supporting applications of the MDS. Study possible improvements for the service of the Data Gap Detector, related to the MDS system.\nDeliverables:\nThe expected deliverables are:\nTerraform scripts with the implementation of a variety of alarms for the MDS system in its testing environment, as well as for its \"Failover\" environment. Documentation of the investigation of different alternatives for the implementation of an alarm system for the supporting applications of the MDS. Implementation and documentation of the alarm system that monitors the status of the supporting applications of the MDS.

      "description": "Tittle:\nDevelopment of Automated Generation of deployment.yaml and compose.yaml files for AES Framework.\nPurpose:\nTo automate the generation of deployment.yaml and compose.yaml files for AES Offline services from a unified configuration dictionary, reduce information redundancy, and prepare the framework for deploying into a Kubernetes cluster.\nDescription:\nCurrently, each AES Offline service maintains its own individual deployment configuration under directory services/<app name>/deploy/. It uses compose files (compose.yml) for instructing docker swarm on the deployment configuration. The student will develop an Ansible role that automatically generates Kubernetes deployment.yaml files and Docker Swarm compatible compose.yml files from a single configuration file that contains a single dictionary. This dictionary will contain all necessary information for deployment configuration, many of which are already declared in each application's existing deploy/compose.yml files. The solution will significantly reduce the number of configuration files that need to be maintained if Kubernetes deployment gets supported by AES Framework. While ensuring that all applications remain aligned with consistent deployment standards.\nIn essence, this implementation will facilitate the transition from Docker Swarm to Kubernetes by providing a unified source of configuration that can generate appropriate files for either orchestration platform. The automated generation approach will also extend to internal and external proxy configurations, which will be defined within the same application configuration dictionary and used to generate the corresponding proxy configuration files. This approach will improve maintainability, reduce configuration drift between environments, and provide a solid foundation for managing the complex deployment requirements of ALMA's scientific computing infrastructure.\nObjectives:\nGeneral Objective:\nDevelop Ansible role tasks within the AES Framework to automatically generate deployment and compose files for Offline services from a unified configuration dictionary, supporting both Kubernetes and Docker Swarm deployments while integrating external and internal proxy configurations.\nSpecific Objectives:\nStudy the AES Framework used for deploying ALMA OFFLINE Services.\nAnalyze existing deploy/compose.yml files across AES Offline applications to identify common configuration patterns and parameters.\nDesign a comprehensive configuration dictionary structure that consolidates deployment parameters from existing files.\nCreate Ansible tasks within a dedicated role to generate Kubernetes deployment files from the unified dictionary.\nCreate Ansible tasks within the same role to generate Docker Compose files from the unified dictionary.\nImplement internal proxy configuration generation as part of the automated deployment file creation process.\nDeliverables:\nThe expected deliverables are:\nGit repository/branch (docker repo) with the necessary changes to the configuration that we already have.\nConfiguration dictionary schema documentation defining the structure and required parameters for application configurations.\nTemplate files for generating both Kubernetes deployment files and Docker Compose files from the unified dictionary.\nImplementation guide documenting how to use the new role.\nDeadline for applications:\n Friday, October 24th, 2025, 12 pm Chile time.",

Desirable for WSU tasks and mitigating the security risks of having network switches exposed.\nDescription:\nThe Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is one of the most advanced astronomical observatories in the world. It is located in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. Its scientific mission depends on highly complex software systems that coordinate operations, manage large-scale data processing, and continuously deliver reliable services to support astronomical research. One of the many tasks that is performed at Software Support Operations at ALMA Department of Computing, consists in virtually moving/tracking different sorts of resources (such as antennas, computers, between other kinds of hardware devices) across distinct environments/locations in OSF (Operations Support Facility) for different scenarios, such as Science Operations, Engineering Maintenance, Software Testing, etc. Many of those operations are done using network switches configuration on-the-fly, via different scripts and platforms across the system (moveSteComponents, moveAntennas, VRFS, among others). In the following periods, resource movement activity will be highly increased due to an ongoing upgrade in the observatory (Wide-sensitivity upgrade); then having a reliable and secure tool for tracking the location and making movements of different resources is highly desirable for next periods.\nThis internship will focus on studying, planning, and implementing an API capable of managing the resource location and movement in a unified way, which existing and future scripts and internal platforms will use. The student will study and get to know the observatory infrastructure, then will help to create a potential mechanism for locating resources across ALMA infrastructure/network and moving these between different internal environments. Through this experience, the student will gain practical experience implementing solutions for state-of-the-art infrastructure, working with multi-disciplinary teams, and deepening knowledge in operations, support, and networking in a distributed system. The internship will also provide opportunities to collaborate with experienced engineers, understand the challenges of maintaining critical systems, and develop solutions that contribute directly to the robustness of the software processes in ALMA.\nObjectives:\nGeneral objective\nStudy, design, and develop an API capable of moving and tracking various resources across environments at ALMA Operations Support Facility.\nSpecific objectives\nStudy ALMA ONLINE Infrastructure to learn core concepts like resource types, locations, and network infrastructure.\nInvestigate and test a potential way to get and move the location of different resources across ALMA using existing infrastructure.\nUsing the proposed solutions, design and develop an API that could centrally handle resource movements and location querying.\nProvide proper documentation for maintenance and troubleshooting.\nDeliverables:\nThe expected deliverables are:\nDocuments explaining a potential way to obtaining resource locations performing resource movements.\nGit repository with an implementation of the API.\nDocumentation of the implemented API.\n﻿\nDeadline for applications: \nFriday, October 24th, 12 pm Chile time\nWorking location: \nSantiago Central Office, or Operations Support Facility (OSF- Close to San Pedro de Atacama) in a 8X6 shift.",

      "description": "Tittle:\nImplementation of Kubernetes for AES Framework Infrastructure and Deployment of Offline Services.\nPurpose:\n \nTo avoid obsolescence risks, implement the deployment on a Kubernetes cluster of Offline services using the AES Framework.\nDescription:\nThe ALMA OFFLINE applications are a central part of the data processing workflow inside the observatory, but are also very relevant for the rest of the Observatory's main processes. More than 40 applications are deployed in each release in production, and all of them are continuously tested following the software delivery process of the observatory. It's crucial for these applications to work properly once they are deployed in production. Currently, these applications are built as Docker images and deployed in a Docker Swarm cluster. There are separate Docker Swarm clusters for the different testing and production environments. Regarding production environments, there are two at JAO (one at OSF and another at SCO) and one at each of the ARCs, making a total of five production environments. One important achievement of the current implementation of the AES framework is that these five production environments, and the services that run inside them, are configured and deployed in a standardized way. This facilitates the reproducibility of any potential issue and the maintainability of all these environments. However, there are growing concerns about the future of Docker Swarm since the acquisition of Docker by a commercial company. Hence, migrating to Kubernetes is important in order to align with the current industry standards and best practices and long-term needs. It is expected that the current AES framework can be modified instead of having Docker Swarm as the final backend orchestrator, to replace/ update the corresponding portions of the framework, so that the Offline Services can be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster, and this cluster could also be automatically generated and configured as it is now. By having this new option to deploy on Kubernetes, the organization facilitates greater reliability, flexibility in multi-cloud or hybrid environments, and a future proof platform for managing ALMA Offline containerized services.\nObjectives:\nGeneral Objective:\nImplement the capability to provide the infrastructure and deployment of ALMA Offline services using the AES Framework into a Kubernetes cluster.\nSpecific Objectives:\nStudy the AES Framework used for deploying ALMA OFFLINE Services.\nStudy the AES Framework infrastructure provisioning for Docker and Docker-swarm.\nUnderstand the current containerization and orchestration approach based on Docker and Docker Swarm.\nResearch Kubernetes features, tools, and best practices applicable to the AES Framework.\nImplement a proof of concept (PoC) of Kubernetes deployment using the AES Framework.\nDeliverables:\nThe expected deliverables are:\nGit repository/branch (docker repo) with the necessary changes to the configuration that we already have.\nDocument the results of the research on how to implement and adapt the AES Framework for Kubernetes deployment.\nDocument the results of the research on how to implement and adapt the AES Framework for Kubernetes infrastructure provisioning.\nDepending on the results of the previous investigation, a preliminary/proof-of-concept implementation of the solution.\nDeadline for applications: \nFriday, October 24th, 2025 at 12 pm Chile time.\n﻿",
